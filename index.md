# Lost Vrysaki Project

During the summer of 2025, scholars gathered at the Princeton Athens Center to explore digital humanities methods for mapping and spatial visualization. Participants were introduced to key topics, including spatial data collection, geocoding, georeferencing, data wrangling, different types of maps, mapping and visualization platforms, and hosting. This hands-on workshop used objects from the [Messinesi Photographs Collection](https://collections.visualresources.princeton.edu/Detail/collections/155) which is part of the [Homer A. Thompson Collection](https://collections.visualresources.princeton.edu/Detail/collections/58) house in [Visual Resources Collections](https://collections.visualresources.princeton.edu/) of Princeton University's Department of Art and Archaeology.
 
The result was a project prototype that includes a dataset and the following map:
