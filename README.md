# Lost Vrysaki Prototype
This project emerged from a [2025 Summer Institute at the Princeton Athens Center](https://princeton-cdh.github.io/athens2025/). Instructors included scholars from Princetonâ€™s Center for Digital Humanities (CDH), Princeton University Library, the Visual Resources Department of Art and Archaeology, and the MSc Program in Digital Methods for the Humanities at the Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB).

The project uses objects from the [Messinesi Photographs Collection](https://collections.visualresources.princeton.edu/Detail/collections/155) which is part of the [Homer A. Thompson Collection](https://collections.visualresources.princeton.edu/Detail/collections/58) house in [Visual Resources Collections](https://collections.visualresources.princeton.edu/) of Princeton University's Department of Art and Archaeology.

This project uses the template from the [HandsOnDataViz Tutorial](https://handsondataviz.org/leaflet-maps-with-csv.html).
